Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i> </p> </div> <br>

in my journey in online class has been a blast, for you see i have social anxiety i dont get to meet people in real life that much i ussually just eet virtually cause that makes my social anxiety feel better if we were not meeting face to face, but ever since i met new friends here in science high made my socil anxiety a bit better in grade 7 i was so shy to raise my hand or even speak but i am getting a bit better here now but i dont know if i can handle the preassure of meeting people in face to face but i can try, but i am socially awkward though.and im gonna do my very best in class not only for me but fpor my family and God will be there by my side to guide me. </i> </p> </div> <br>
